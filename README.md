# Layers

[Experience the work here.](https://dad.lucas-levin.com)

An interactive sound experiment for the [Dover Arts Development Digital Festival](https://www.dadonline.uk/digital-festival/) by [Lucas Levin](https://lucas-levin.com).

## The work

Numerous sound layers of varying intensity are mixed together, including:

- Construction work
- Heavy traffic
- Public transport
- Children playing
- A quiet street
- _Beata Progenies_ by Leonel Power (1370 - 1445), an English sacred motet in a piano arrangement performed by [Yi-Shing Cheng](https://yishingcheng.com)
- Sounds from a forest

As each person listens, they erode away the layers. As more people listen, the work progresses from being primarily loud, city noise to only the quiet sounds of nature.

This is happening at every moment of listening; thus the start of the work is likely to be more eroded than the end. Periodically, it is rebuilt, with all the layers reforming.

The musical focus is motet, yet it is nearly impossible to hear while all the layers are in place, and it is, ultimately, also eroded away.

## Background

This work is a response to upcoming (commencing 2022) redevelopment of the Maison Dieu in Dover, England. I was very privileged to be given a behind-the-scenes tour of the ongoing preparatory research and discovery process before the restoration commences, and one aspect that made a particularly lasting impression was the rich layered history that can be found in such an ancient building.

In more than 800 years of use, it has been a hospital, a military base, storage, courtroom, prison, general meeting place and place of government. The very walls are palimpsests, with patches at the time of my visit uncovered to reveal ancient tiles, decorations and paintwork from its past.

The Leonel Power's motet is very likely to have been heard many times in the Maison Dieu.

Thank you for reading this far.
